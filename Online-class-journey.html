        <h1>REFLECTION: "My Online Class Journey"</h1>
        <p style="border: 3px solid tomato; padding: 2px;"><i>Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i></p>
        <div style="background-color: hsl(10, 100%, 80%); margin: 30px 0; padding: 10px;">
            <p>My first thought when online-learning was announced I was sad and worried, but after for a while I am used to online-classes now and turned out that I have a better and faster rate of doing assignments because it is in my computer and I can basically multitask. But aside from that, my experience <b>IN</b> online classes is fun and interesting. My classmates are friendly and cooperative with each other, and I have even few classmates that are funny. There is one particular classmate that is curious in a way that is hilarious. I like online classes, and if soon enough, when the pandemic is over, hopefully online classes can be used for some subjects :p </p>
